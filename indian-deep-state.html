                <p> <i>This was originally written as a <a href="https://x.com/virajraundal8/status/1874225179423105255">twitter thread</a>.</i></p>

                <p>I feel like every country's political class has their own bipartisan agendas and we recognise these as the agendas of the &quot;deep state&quot;. These agendas generally stay the same unless an outsider comes in a creates a new political class which then creates their own agendas. This isn't just limited to the outsiders. A contrarian political leader or a humungous change in global order (thanks to wars) result in an upheaval of the deep state. The US and the UK after the two world wars are a good example for this I believe.</p>

                <p>Within ~40 years, the UK went from optimising for conquering as much land as possible, waging war on any and every corner of the planet to electing a relative outsider, PM Atlee, who had to deal with the aftermath of the WW2 and just chose to let go of the prior beliefs of the UK. The US on the other hand went from being a regional player in the Americas and the pacifc to a global superpower at who's heart lay the interests of American businesses.</p>

                <p>I believe the American &quot;deep state&quot; believes in only 2 things:</p>

                <p>1) Territorial integrity of the US 2) Absolute and undisputed domination of American businesses in all fields globally</p>

                <p>everything they do contributes to either or both of these two points. They are also correlated. Without territorial integrity, you just can't have (2) and without (2) you will, one day, lose (1).</p>

                <p>Now, I believe every nation believes in (1), except for probably Pak till '71, but only the Modern day US and Japan (till the Plaza accords) have believed in (2). With Trump in the White House, I can only see #2 accelerate beyond comprehension.</p>

                <p>In India's case I believe our deep state also focuses on 2 points:</p>

                <p>1) Obsessive focus on territorial integrity (as they should) 2) Trying to prevent the uprising of the poor against democracy</p>

                <p>The Indian state at some point seems to have settled on an idea that the poor may lead to the rise of authoritarianism and ultimately the disintegration of the republic. Hence the cash dole outs, MSP, all sorts of subsidies etc.</p>

                <p>Ofcourse, they realise that the greater threat is not from its own people but foreign (Pak/China/US) aggression and hence the nuclear triad exists along with a strong navy, army and, although dwindling, a pretty good air force.</p>

                <p>What they don't realise is that none of this matters if we don't do indigenous RnD and have the interests of our businesses at the core of pretty much everything we do.</p>

                <p>The only way for the Indian republic to stay together and possibly expand from here is to accelerate, innovate and manufacture instead of just trying to buy technology or partner with foreign companies.</p>

                <p>We must have a pro-capitalism, pro-STEM, pro-business, and a pro-India deep state. Currently socialism is bipartisan. From the AIMIM to the BJP, no one speaks against socialism.</p>

                <p>This must change and we must make Capitalism and growth of Indian businesses a bipartisan issue.</p>

                <p>Looks highly improbable tho given how hard it is for an outsider to join politics, let alone be the PM. Can't speak about a global order upheaval but that's highly unlikely too.</p>

                <p>I don't know how to do this but I hope this gets done sooner then later.</p>
